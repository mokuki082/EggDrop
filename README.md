# EggDrop

> IMPORTANT MENTION: The art of this game "EggDrop" is originally intended to be made for TurtleBrains, a C++ Game Engine. [Check out TurtleBrains here](https://www.timbeaudet.com/). I met the developer of TurtleBrains: Tim Beaudet a little while ago at Ludum Dare. Tim is a great developer, and I agreed to make the assets for one of TurtleBrains tutorials (Egg Drop). It is still the most important use of this art. I made this game as a practice and used the art that I made for TurtleBrains back then as the base of the game (also added more as I went). I thought I'd put it up here because I quite like it :D. I give all the rights for TurtleBrains to use the the arts in this game for their tutorial.

## About

EggDrop is simple drop and catch game.

You are a chicken mum trying to save your precious golden eggs. Occasionally a chicken baby will fall from the sky to heal you with its little flapping wings. Be aware of the stone eggs though, there are a lot of them and getting hit by stone is going to hurt the chicken mum quite badly.

You can also have a race with your friend and see whose chicken mum is capable of saving more golden eggs.

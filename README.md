## About

A simple drop and catch game created using Pygame.

You are a chicken mum trying to save your precious golden eggs. Occasionally a chicken baby will fall from the sky to heal you with its little flapping wings. Be aware of the stone eggs though, there are a lot of them and getting hit by stone is going to hurt the chicken mum quite badly.

You can also have a race with your friend and see whose chicken mum is capable of saving more golden eggs.

## About

>IMPORTANT MENTION:
>The art of this game "EggDrop" is originally intended to be made for TurtleBrains, a C++ Game Engine.
[Check out TurtleBrains here](https://www.timbeaudet.com/). I met the developer of TurtleBrains: Tim Beaudet a little while ago at Ludum Dare, our styles matched so I agreed to make the assets for one of TurtleBrains tutorials (Egg Drop).
It is still the most important use of this art. I made this game as a practice (still a game dev newbie :3). I used the art that I made for TurtleBrains back then as the base of the game, and added more as I went. I thought I'd put it up here because I quite like it :D. I give all the rights for TurtleBrains to use the some of the arts of this game.


EggDrop is simple drop and catch game.

You are a chicken mum trying to save your precious golden eggs. Occasionally a chicken baby will fall from the sky to heal you with its little flapping wings. Be aware of the stone eggs though, there are a lot of them and getting hit by stone is going to hurt the chicken mum quite badly.

You can also have a race with your friend and see whose chicken mum is capable of saving more golden eggs.
